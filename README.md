# Parallel Search and Sorting Algorithms with MPI

This project demonstrates the implementation of parallel search and sorting algorithms using **MPI (Message Passing Interface)** in C++. It showcases efficient distributed algorithm design and performance analysis through practical, hands-on simulations.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

* Modular CLI to select and run any algorithm
* MPI-based parallel implementations:

  * Quick Search
  * Prime Number Finding
  * Bitonic Sort
  * Radix Sort
  * Sample Sort (Bonus)
* Dynamic input loading via text files
* Output sorted results to file (for sorting algorithms)
* Performance measured using `MPI_Wtime()`

## ðŸ§° Prerequisites

* **Microsoft MPI** (or any MPI implementation)
* **g++** compiler (MinGW or equivalent for Windows)

## ðŸš€ Compilation and Execution (Windows)

### Step 1: Compile

```bash
build.bat
```

> This compiles using Microsoft MPI include and lib directories.

### Step 2: Run with 4 Processes

```bash
mpiexec -n 4 a.exe
```

## ðŸ§ª Input Format

Each algorithm reads from a plain `.txt` file:

* **Quick Search / Sorting:** One number per line
* **Prime Finder:** Enter start and end range via CLI

Example for input file:

```
90 12 33 5 87 56 41 21 69 50
```

## ðŸ“‹ Usage Demo

```bash
===============================================
